# FINAL INSIGHTS

1. The company should focus more on technology section because the profit is higher in the that cateogory								
2. Since furniture is not contributing towards any profit , so the company can stop selling furniture .											
3. If the shipping mode is " same day" , the shipping charges should be increased as the profit is almost neglible when the ship mode is same day.																
4. The main reason for loss is discounts as profit and discounts are negatively correlated . That means when the discounts are increased in one area it results in loss  . This needs to be improved.												
5. South region of the country has the least sales , so focus should be made on cities in south region.									
6. Focus should be made on Technology category as they are most selling and profitable cateogeries.
